# Push a train to its own branch, let CI be the gate, and advance main only on
# green. Operator tooling runs through the real GitHub CLI (gh) via watch-ci.sh;
# the shim is only for AI agent commands.
#
# Lifting this into another repository: carry four files together —
# scripts/train-push.sh, scripts/watch-ci.sh, scripts/lib/operator-gh.sh,
# scripts/lib/workflow-gates.py — plus `python3`, `git`, and the real `gh` on
# PATH. Nothing else here assumes this repository's layout: the default branch
# is read from origin/HEAD, and repo-local preflights run only when their
# scripts exist (see "Repo-local preflights" below), with the header line
# naming which ones ran.
#
# Why this is the default push path instead of scripts/gated-push.sh:
# the local full Rust gate takes ~12 minutes on this box and only sees macOS.
# Measured over the last week, about half the red trains failed on Linux or
# Windows only, so on those the local gate was paid for and could not have
# caught the failure. It also runs in the one working tree, so trains serialize
# behind each other and compete with worker sessions for this box's CPU (hence
# the box gate, the nice steering, and peers asking for quiet windows). CI runs
# the three platforms in parallel on other hardware in ~11-16 minutes.
#
# The contract we keep is "main is never red". That is a property of what lands
# on main, not of where the tests ran: nothing lands here except a sha whose CI
# run concluded success, and it lands by fast-forward only - never a merge,
# never a force. gated-push.sh stays for the work whose failures only reproduce
# locally (watcher/fseventsd, macOS exec assessment).
#
# EDIT THIS FILE BY WRITE-TEMP-THEN-RENAME, NEVER IN PLACE. A running bash holds
# an open fd and reads on by byte offset, so an in-place write (same inode) makes
# a live train resume at the wrong offset and die on a syntax error in code it
# never reached - "line 789: syntax error near unexpected token `('" in a file
# that passes `bash -n` before and after. A rename into place (new inode) leaves
# the live run on the old bytes. Measured both ways by BROCA; AFT restored bytes
# under a live train once. Nothing lands from such a death: it happens before
# the landing push, and the ref left behind is the recoverable repush state.
#
# A MERGE IS ITSELF A TRAIN PUSH. Under required status checks, a merge commit
# made locally has no check of its own - main's protection sees an unchecked
# sha and refuses the push, however green both sides were separately. So do the
# merge on the train branch, let CI run on the merge sha, and fast-forward main
# to that same sha. A merge commit whose first parent is origin/main is already
# a descendant of it, so it fast-forwards like any other train.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/train-push.sh <train-name>
#   scripts/train-push.sh <train-name> --land
#   scripts/train-push.sh <train-name> -- <local smoke command...>
#
# The optional smoke is the targeted slice the diff touches (the one or two
# suites you would rerun by hand), NOT the full gate. It exists to catch an
# obvious break before spending a CI run.
#
# A red train leaves origin/train/<train-name> in place: fix, commit, and run
# this script again with the same name to update the branch and re-run CI.
#
# If main moves while CI runs, the train is re-queued automatically: rebase onto
# the new origin/main, re-push the branch, watch a fresh run - up to 3 rounds.
# The re-queue is for a moved branch ONLY. A red run is never retried: the same
# tree on a new base is red for the same reason, and version/lock skew in
# particular ends in a lockfile bump commit rather than in any retry.
#
# THE INVARIANT THE RE-QUEUE KEEPS: only the sha a check actually ran against
# may fast-forward main. A green run for the pre-rebase sha proves something
# about a base that no longer exists, so it never authorizes the landing of the
# rebased commit; the rebased sha gets pushed and waits for its own run. That is
# also why a moved main cannot be resolved by pushing the old sha harder.
#
# RELEASES ARE TRAINS TOO. Under required checks a release tag must point at a
# sha that is already on the default branch by fast-forward and carries the
# green check, so the sequence is: train, fast-forward, tag the green sha. The
# local full gate drops out of the release scripts along with everything else -
# tagging a locally-gated sha that never went through a train produces a tag
# whose commit no check ever saw.
#
# WHERE BRANCH PROTECTION IS UNAVAILABLE (a private repo on a Free plan has no
# required status checks), this script's fast-forward-only-on-green IS the gate.
# Nothing on the server will stop a direct push then, so the discipline of
# pushing through here is the whole of the contract.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  landed on the default branch
#   1  CI red (or a push that reported success without moving origin)
#   2  precondition refusal, bad usage, failed smoke, or no CI run resolved
#   3  the default branch kept moving through 3 re-queue rounds, or the rebase
#      conflicted
#   4  CI is green, but landing failed; re-run with --land to finish without
#      paying for another CI run

# REFUSE A CONCURRENT TRAIN. Two trains overlap the moment one is backgrounded and
# another started - which is exactly what an operator wants to do, because a train
# takes minutes and waiting is dull. They are not concurrent-safe: each resolves
# HEAD and moves refs on one remote, so the second can land the first's commits,
# or find main already where it meant to put it and report a failure over a
# landing that succeeded. That false failure is the mild outcome; the dangerous
# one is a train landing a sha its CI never tested.
#
# A remote train/* ref is NOT the signal: a ref outlives its process (a red CI
# leaves the ref as the repush target, and the same train name is re-run round
# after round), and a ref arrives late (a train between resolve-HEAD and push
# holds no ref yet, so a second train in that window would be permitted - the
# exact concurrency to refuse). A pid is the direct observable. The lock below
# is a record, not a mutex: it means nothing unless its process is alive, so a
# SIGKILLed train (no trap runs) leaves a file the next scan clears. No EXIT
# trap on purpose - bash traps are global and a function further down sets one.
#
# Limit: the lock is local, refs are remote, so this sees trains on this box
# only. One operator, one box here; a second machine driving the same remote is
