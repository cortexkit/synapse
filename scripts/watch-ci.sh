# Operator tooling runs through the real GitHub CLI (gh); the shim is only for AI agent commands.
# Watch a CI run and FAIL FAST: exit the moment any job concludes 'failure',
# without waiting for the rest of the run. Exit 0 only when the whole run
# succeeds. Prints the first failing job's failed-test lines on the way out.
#
# WATCH_CI_SETTLE=1: on failure, keep waiting until the RUN completes before
# exiting nonzero. Chains that intend to `"$OPERATOR_GH" run rerun --failed`
# need this - a rerun request against a still-running run is refused ("cannot
# be rerun; This workflow is already running"), which has burned rerun-then-watch
# chains twice. Fail-fast reporting still prints immediately; only the exit
# is deferred to rerun-safety.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/watch-ci.sh            # run for the local HEAD sha
#   scripts/watch-ci.sh <run-id>
#   scripts/watch-ci.sh <sha>      # run for any branch head, e.g. a train branch
#   WATCH_CI_SETTLE=1 scripts/watch-ci.sh <run-id>
